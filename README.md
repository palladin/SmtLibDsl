# CogitoCore

An experimental project exploring the combination of **dependently-typed Lean DSL for SMT-LIB** with **Z3** and **powerful LLMs** to solve challenging reasoning puzzles and problems.

## The Idea

CogitoCore leverages the strengths of multiple paradigms:

- **Lean 4**: A dependently-typed functional programming language that enables precise, type-safe specifications
- **SMT-LIB / Z3**: Industry-standard satisfiability modulo theories solver for automated reasoning
- **Large Language Models**: AI-powered understanding and problem decomposition

By combining formal verification techniques with modern AI capabilities, CogitoCore aims to tackle complex logical reasoning tasks that neither approach could solve alone.
